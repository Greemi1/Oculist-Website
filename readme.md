# Introduction
Hi all,
I'm a beginner and this is my first public project and I would ask for a code review. What should I improve, change, or use something differently.

## Description
This is the website of an eye clinic. On the site we can find information about the place, services, doctors, reviews and contact with the clinic. If we want, we can make an appointment with the doctor right away.
The site is fully responsive and contains various animations
